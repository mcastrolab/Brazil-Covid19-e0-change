__Fig. 2 Changes in gaps of life expectancy at birth and age 65 by state and sex.__  
__(a)__ Change (in years) in the female-male gap in life expectancy at birth and age 65 based on the difference from life tables calculated for 2019 and 2020 by state and sex. Lines represent changes for Brazil. Bars, organized by major regions, show changes for the states. State acronyms by region, North: AC=Acre, AP=Amapá, AM=Amazonas, PA=Pará, RO=Rondônia, RR=Roraima, and TO=Tocantins; Northeast: AL=Alagoas, BA=Bahia, CE=Ceará, MA=Maranhão, PB=Paraíba, PE=Pernambuco, PI=Piauí, RN=Rio Grande do Norte, and SE=Sergipe; Center-West: DF=Distrito Federal, GO=Goiás, MT=Mato Grosso, and MS=Mato Grosso do Sul; Southeast: ES=Espírito Santo, MG=Minas Gerais; RJ=Rio de Janeiro, and SP=São Paulo; South: PR=Paraná, RS=Rio Grande do Sul, and SC=Santa Catarina. __(b)__ Gap (in years) in state life expectancy at birth and age 65 in 2019 and 2020, calculated as the difference between the largest and smallest life expectancy among states __(Methods)__. Labels above bars indicate the states with extreme (high, low) life expectancies in 2019 and 2020.
