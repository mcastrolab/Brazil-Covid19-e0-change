## Abstract

Brazil has been heavily impacted by COVID-19. We use data on reported total deaths in 2020 and in Jan-Apr 2021 to measure and compare the death toll across states. We estimate a decline in 2020 life expectancy at birth (*e0*) of 1.3 years, a mortality level not seen since 2014. The reduction in life expectancy at age 65 (*e65*) in 2020 was 0.9 year, setting Brazil back to 2012 levels. The decline was larger for males, widening by 9.1% the female-male gap in *e0*. Among states, Amazonas lost 60.4% of the improvements in *e0* since 2000. In the first four months of 2021, COVID-19 deaths represented 107% of the total 2020 figures. Assuming that death rates would have been equal to 2019 all-cause rates in the absence of COVID-19, COVID-19 deaths in 2021 have already reduced *e0* in 2021 by 1.8 years, which is slightly larger than the reduction estimated for 2020 under similar assumptions.
